## Description
- This project is an implementation of the paper's proposed Color Channel Fusion Network (CCFN) for enhancing low-light images. 
- The goal is to improve image quality in challenging low-light conditions using deep learning technique proposed using CCN, MFN and DEN. 
And the model is to be trained on LoL Dataset unlike the proposed SICE dataset in the paper for testing purpose.
- The implementation is written in PyTorch and is currently a work in progress. 

Feel free to check the code and provide feedback.
